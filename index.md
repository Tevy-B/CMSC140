# CMSC140
Introduces programming and problem solving using a contemporary programming language. Topics include principles of procedural programming, software development and debugging techniques, control structures, data types, functions, one-dimensional arrays, and file processing. 

## Take-Aways
Upon completing this course, I had learned how to use `C++` programming language to:
- Demonstrate the ability to design, write, test, and debug computer programs using procedural techniques
- Demonstrate the basic syntax and expressions of the programming language in use.
- Select and apply the appropriate control structure.
- Implement top down design techniques and subprogramming.
- Declare and process one-dimensional arrays, including implementation of algorithms for searching and sorting arrays
- Use simple file input and output operations
